# Employee-Manager

This project was implemented as an exercise to learn Angular and Spring Boot stack, following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx4iBLKLVHk) video. The backend was adapted to use a Docker image of PostgreSQL instead of MySQL. Angular 16.1.0 was used for front-end. Spring Boot 3.1.0 was used for back-end.
